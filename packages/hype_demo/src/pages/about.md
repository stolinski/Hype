# About

[See the code](https://github.com/stolinski/Hype/blob/main/src/pages/about.ts)

Take a look. It's nothing special yet, but it has potential.

## What's going on here?

Hype is a ~~meta~~ framework for easily and quickly building hyperfast websites and apps with HTMX & Bun.

This is trying to be a battery buddy of a framework. It holds your batteries. It's batteries included.

ðŸ”‹ So what are those batteries

- âœ… Server Routing Via ElysiaJS
- âœ… Database & ORM via Drizzle (sqlite easy ootb)
- âœ… HTML & JavaScript as template engine
- âœ… File based routing without pain
- âœ… Browser live reload
- âœ… Markdown File Routes
- âœ… HTML File Routes
- âŒ› A legit default template with easy mods and overrides (coming soon)
- âŒ› Layouts (coming soon)
- âŒ› Auth (coming soon)
- âŒ› Form Generation (coming soon)
- âŒ› Admin (coming soon)
- âŒ› Animations (coming soon)
- âŒ› Client side helpers (coming soon)
- âŒ› Scoped CSS (coming whenever Firefox adds @scope)

#### The tech

- Elysia,
- HTMX
- HTML
- Bun
- Drizzle
- SQLite
- Biome

Poke around but just know that nothing is final.

### Why?

HTMX is sick and there are a ton of competing stacks and frameworks to use it in. This is trying to be THE JavaScript based way to write HTMX apps with batteries included. Meteor was my favorite framework, so just keep that in mind.

### Interesting Features

Since args don't rerun components, we can pass a ton of props into them like the entire request and context info. Think Locals for svelte but in your component.
